**Today's Progress**: Day 18 - 24 of #100DaysofCode - Finally finished the rock, paper, scissors project! I know it’s not the most unique project in the world but it’s a start! I didn't get as much work done this week as I would like so I'm going to make up for it by increasing my work input. 

### Day 17: December 15, 2023

**Today's Progress**:Spent 3 hours working on the rock, paper, scissors project. Difficult but I’m taking it step by step. I started my first “pseudocode” document, and I know it’s not the best but I just wanted to get my thoughts down. I will improve it as I go along.

### Day 16: December 14, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Today I did some JS problems on functions and I learned about the problem-solving process. I learned that you should understand the problem, plan out the steps, and then take out the smallest problems to link the dots. Thanks for reading!

### Day 10: December 8, 2023

**Today's Progress**: For TOP, I finished the alignment problems for flexbox and also started the landing page project. I’ve really enjoyed all of the problem solving for the CSS exercises and I'm looking forward to tackle the rest of the course! Thanks for reading! :D 

### Day 9: December 7, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Today, I completed around 1/2 of the alignment exercises for the TOP. This was definitely challenging but I was able to it done. I looked at the solutions for the exercises only when I attempted first. Thanks for reading!

### Day 8: December 6, 2023
